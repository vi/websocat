## Features

* Connecting to and serving WebSockets from command line.
* Executing external program and making it communicate to WebSocket using stdin/stdout.
* Text and binary modes, converting between lines (or null-terminated records) and messages.
* Inetd mode, UNIX sockets (including abstract namespaced on Linux).
* Integration with Nginx using TCP or UNIX sockets.
* Directly using unauthenticated SOCKS5 servers for connecting to WebSockets and listening WebSocket connection.
* Auto-reconnect and connection-reuse modes.
* Linux, Windows and Mac support, with [pre-built executables][releases].
* Low-level WebSocket clients and servers with overridable underlying transport connection, e.g. calling external program to serve as a transport for websocat (for SSL, proxying, etc.).

[releases]:https://github.com/vi/websocat/releases

# Installation

There are multiple options for installing WebSocat. From easy to hard:

* If you're on Linux Debian or Ubuntu (or other dpkg-based), try downloading a pre-build deb package from [GitHub releases][releases] and install from GUI or with command like `gdebi websocat_..._.deb`
* If you're on Fedora, you can install WebSocat from [Copr](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/atim/websocat/): `sudo dnf copr enable atim/websocat -y && sudo dnf install websocat`
* If you're on FreeBSD, you may install WebSocat with the following command: `pkg install websocat`.
* If you're on macOS, you can do:
  * `brew install websocat` using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh)
  * `sudo port install websocat` using [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org)
* Download a pre-build executable and install it to PATH.
* Install the [Rust toolchain](https://rustup.rs/) and do `cargo install --features=ssl websocat`. If something fails with a `-sys` crate, try without `--features=ssl`;
* Build Websocat from source code (see below), then move `target/release/websocat` somewhere to the PATH.

## Rust versions

|Websocat versions|Minimal Rust version|
|----|----|
| 1.9 - 1.10| 1.46 |
| 1.6 - 1.8 | 1.34 |
| 1.3 - 1.5 | 1.31 |
| 1.2       | 1.28 |
| 1.0-1.1   | 1.23 |

Early non-async versions of Websocat should be buildable by even older rustc.  
Note that old versions of Websocat may misbehave if built by Rust 1.48 or later due to https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/71274/.


Pre-built binaries for Linux (usual and musl), Windows, OS X and Android are available on the [releases page](https://github.com/vi/websocat/releases).


Building from source code
---

1. Install the [Rust toolchain](https://rustup.rs/)
2. `cargo build --release --features=ssl`.
3. Find the executable somewhere under `target/`, e.g. in `target/release/websocat`.


SSL on Android
---

websocat's `wss://` may fail on Android. As a workaround, download certificate bundle, for example, from https://curl.haxx.se/ca/cacert.pem and specify it explicitly:

    SSL_CERT_FILE=cacert.pem /data/local/tmp/websocat wss://echo.websocket.org

Or just use `--insecure` option.

Documentation
---

Basic usage examples are provided at the top of this README and in `--help` message. More tricks are described in [moreexamples.md](./moreexamples.md).

There is a [list of all address types and overlays](doc.md).

```
websocat 1.10.0
Vitaly "_Vi" Shukela <vi0oss@gmail.com>
Command-line client for web sockets, like netcat/curl/socat for ws://.

USAGE:
    websocat ws://URL | wss://URL               (simple client)
    websocat -s port                            (simple server)
    websocat [FLAGS] [OPTIONS] <addr1> <addr2>  (advanced mode)

FLAGS:
	--stdout-announce-listening-ports       [A] Print a line to stdout for each port being listened
	--async-stdio                           [A] On UNIX, set stdin and stdout to nonblocking mode instead of
						spawning a thread. This should improve performance, but may break other
						programs running on the same console.
	--crypto-reverse                        [A] Swap encryption and decryption operations in `crypto:` specifier -
						encrypt on read, decrypto on write.
	--dump-spec                             [A] Instead of running, dump the specifiers representation to stdout
    -e, --set-environment                       Set WEBSOCAT_* environment variables when doing exec:/cmd:/sh-c:
						Currently it's WEBSOCAT_URI and WEBSOCAT_CLIENT for
						request URI and client address (if TCP)
						Beware of ShellShock or similar security problems.
    -E, --exit-on-eof                           Close a data transfer direction if the other one reached EOF
	--foreachmsg-wait-read                  [A] Wait for reading to finish before closing foreachmsg:'s peer
	--jsonrpc                               Format messages you type as JSON RPC 2.0 method calls. First word
						becomes method name, the rest becomes parameters, possibly automatically
						wrapped in [].
	--just-generate-key                     [A] Just a Sec-WebSocket-Key value without running main Websocat
	--linemode-strip-newlines               [A] Don't include trailing \n or \r\n coming from streams in WebSocket
						messages
    -0, --null-terminated                       Use \0 instead of \n for linemode
	--no-line                               [A] Don't automatically insert line-to-message transformation
	--no-exit-on-zeromsg                    [A] Don't exit when encountered a zero message. Zero messages are used
						internally in Websocat, so it may fail to close connection at all.
	--no-fixups                             [A] Don't perform automatic command-line fixups. May destabilize
						websocat operation. Use --dump-spec without --no-fixups to discover what
						is being inserted automatically and read the full manual about Websocat
						internal workings.
	--no-async-stdio                        [A] Inhibit using stdin/stdout in a nonblocking way if it is not a tty
    -1, --one-message                           Send and/or receive only one message. Use with --no-close and/or -u/-U.
	--oneshot                               Serve only once. Not to be confused with -1 (--one-message)
	--print-ping-rtts                       Print measured round-trip-time to stderr after each received WebSocket
						pong.
	--exec-sighup-on-stdin-close            [A] Make exec: or sh-c: or cmd: send SIGHUP on UNIX when input is
						closed.
	--exec-sighup-on-zero-msg               [A] Make exec: or sh-c: or cmd: send SIGHUP on UNIX when facing incoming
						zero-length message.

    -S, --strict                                strict line/message mode: drop too long messages instead of splitting
						them, drop incomplete lines.

	--udp-oneshot                           [A] udp-listen: replies only one packet per client
	--udp-reuseaddr                         [A] Set SO_REUSEADDR for UDP socket. Listening TCP sockets are always
						reuseaddr.
    -u, --unidirectional                        Inhibit copying data in one direction
    -U, --unidirectional-reverse                Inhibit copying data in the other direction (or maybe in both directions
						if combined with -u)
	--accept-from-fd                        [A] Do not call `socket(2)` in UNIX socket listerer peer, start with

    -n, --no-close                              Don't send Close message to websocket on EOF
	--websocket-ignore-zeromsg              [A] Silently drop incoming zero-length WebSocket messages. They may
						cause connection close due to usage of zero-len message as EOF flag
						inside Websocat.
    -t, --text                                  Send message to WebSockets as text messages
	--base64                                Encode incoming binary WebSocket messages in one-line Base64 If
						`--binary-prefix` (see `--help=full`) is set, outgoing WebSocket

						sending.
	--base64-text                           [A] Encode incoming text WebSocket messages in one-line Base64. I don't

Some notes
---

* IPv6 is supported, surround your IP in square brackets or use it as is, depending on context.
* Web socket usage is not obligatory, you can use any specs on both sides.
* Typically one line in binary stream correspond to one WebSocket text message. This is adjustable with options.

Limitations
---

* It is not convenient when text and binary WebSocket messages are mixed. This affects `mirror:` specifier, making it a bit different from ws://echo.websocket.org. There are `--binary-prefix`, `--text-prefix` and `--base64` options to handle mixture of binary and text.
* Current version of Websocat don't receive notification about closed sockets. This makes serving without `-E` or `-u` options or in backpressure scenarios prone to socket leak.
* Readline is not integrated. Users are advices to wrap websocat using [`rlwrap`](https://linux.die.net/man/1/rlwrap) tool for more convenient CLI.
* Build process of current version of Websocat is not properly automated and is fragile.
