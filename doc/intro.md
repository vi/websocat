# Introduction

This is documentation for Websocat4 (which eventually will be designated as just "Websocat").

Websocat is a flexible tool that bridges Web world (with HTTP, WebSockets, browsers) 
and UNIX/networking world (with sockets, processes and file descriptors).

Easiest use is to just serve as as command-line client and server to manually check WebSocket-related
things during development, but it also contains many other socket types and modes.
